of some states .so our project “UNLETTERED SCRUTINY” aims at providing an insight of illiteracy rate existing in districts of telangana ,
i.e we will analyze and visualize the data based on past records ,will map the districts with highest ,lowest illiterates
and make it liable for government so that government can take some improvement steps in order to enhance the literacy rate prevailing in rural districts of governments .
