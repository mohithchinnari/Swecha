**INTRODUCTION:**
 our project UNLETTERED SCRUTINY aims at providing a basic insight of illiteracy rates i.e number of illiterates present in the rural districts of telangana and these data is represented with the help of interactive visualisations 
and displaying them through  a web application. 


**ABSRACT:**
Literacy rate in India is a key for social economic progress,but the India’s literacy rate has increased sluggishly because of the persisting illiterates in the rural and urban areas 
of some states .so our project “UNLETTERED SCRUTINY” aims at providing an insight of illiteracy rate existing in districts of telangana ,
i.e we will analyze and visualize the data based on past records ,will map the districts with highest ,lowest illiterates
and make it available for government(NGO's) i.e common people in form of buliding a website(an interactive website) where all the visualisations are embeeded and can know  the number of uneducated people rate in different districts of telangana ,
so that government can take some improvement steps in order to enhance the literacy rate prevailing in rural districts of governments .


**STEPS INVOLVED:**

    1.Datset collection
    2.Importing libraries
    3.Data analysis 
    4.Data visualisations
    5.performing interactive visualisation(D3.JS,BOKEH)
    6.For mapping Geopandas
    7.deploying web apps using bottle
  
  
  **PIVOTAL TASKS:**
  
  Three major tasks has  been involved :
  
  *  Data Analysis and Data Visualization
  *  Running in a bokeh server (bokeh plots for interactivity)
  * deploying(integrating) bokeh plots to bottle

 **MODULES:**
   
   MODULE 1: Dataset Collection
* searched different websites for the appropriate dataset which matches our idea
* collected the data from Telangana Open Data Portal

**USE(MARKET)**

   with the web application which we build and deploy it will be make available for  education department of telangana government so that govt can take some preventive measures to decline the illiteracy rates.
    

(if any further implementations that we could build ,we will .
