**INTRODUCTION:**
 our project UNLETTERED SCRUTINY aims at providing a basic insight of illiteracy rates i.e number of illiterates present in the rural districts of telangana and these data is represented with the help of interactive visualisations 
and displaying them through  a web application.

i.e we will analyze and visualize the data based on past records ,will map the districts with highest ,lowest illiterates
and make it available for government(NGO's) i.e common people in form of buliding a website(an interactive website) where all the visualisations are embeeded and can know  the number of uneducated people rate in different districts of telangana ,
so that government can take some improvement steps in order to enhance the literacy rate prevailing in rural districts of governments .
