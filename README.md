 ****TITLE:****                                                    ****UNLETTERED SCRUTINY****      
 
 
****INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT:****
 our project UNLETTERED SCRUTINY aims at providing a basic insight of illiteracy rates i.e number of illiterates present in the rural districts of telangana and these data is represented with the help of interactive visualisations 
 and displaying them through  a web application. 


****PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:****
Literacy rate in India is a key for social economic progress,but the India’s literacy rate has increased sluggishly because of the persisting illiterates in the rural and urban areas 
of some states .so our project “UNLETTERED SCRUTINY” aims at providing an insight of illiteracy rate existing in districts of telangana ,
i.e we will analyze and visualize the data based on past records ,will map the districts with highest ,lowest illiterates
and make it available for government(NGO's) i.e common people in form of buliding a website(an interactive website) where all the visualisations are embeeded and can know  the number of uneducated people rate in different districts of telangana ,
so that government can take some improvement steps in order to enhance the literacy rate prevailing in rural districts of governments .


****STEPS INVOLVED:****

    1.Datset collection
    2.Importing libraries
    3.Data analysis 
    4.Data visualisations
    5.performing interactive visualisation(D3.JS,BOKEH)
    6.For mapping Geopandas
    7.deploying web apps using bottle
  
  
  ****PIVOTAL TASKS:****
  
  Three major tasks has  been involved :
  
  *  Data Analysis and Data Visualization
  *  Running in a bokeh server (bokeh plots for interactivity)
  * deploying(integrating) bokeh plots to bottle
 
    ****INSTALLATION OR USAGE REQUIREMENTS:****

     PYTHON         : The python versions above 3.0 can be downloaded.the pre-embeeding libraries supporting for DataScience like matplotlib,numpy makes ease of data analysis and data visualisations.
  
    JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.
                      Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

    NUMPY           : It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object,
                      and tools for working with these arrays.
                      
    MATPLOTLIB      : Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
    
    BOKEH           : Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics,
                      and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.
                      
    BOTTLE          :  Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. It is distributed as a single file module and has no dependencies
                       other than the Python Standard Library.   
                       

 ****SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION:****                       
  USE(MARKET):**

with the web application which we build and deploy it will be make available for  education department of telangana government so that govt can take some preventive measures to decline the illiteracy rates.
(if any further implementations that we could build ,we will).
